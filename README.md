# UltimateFrisbeeStatCompiler
Automated way of tallying and evaluating the data from each game of our Ultimate Frisbee Season during sophomore year in high school.

To protect the identity of my teammates, I did not include the spreadsheets from each game indicating stats per player (i.e. number of catches or blocks player A had in Game 1). 
This was an informal project to save myself and the captain time from having to manually tally each persons cumulative stats, and the final spreadsheet was sent to all the players 
so they could rate their own and their teammates' performances throught the season.
